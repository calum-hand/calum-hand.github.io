#### Education
##### 2019 - Current | University of Bath | PhD in the Centre for Sustainable Circular Technologies (CSCT)
* I have recently started a PhD which combines Monte Carlo simulation and novel machine learning techniques to develop software tools for large scale material screenings
* The machine learning algorithms being developed use data collected from the Monte Carlo simulation of porous materials with gas adsorbates and allow for "in situ" understanding of the ideal adsorbent properties
* This EPSRC funded PhD is supervised by members of the Chemical Engineering, Mathematics departments and a University of Bath Research Software Engineer
* Future work currently looks at the packaging of the algorithm into a tool which is made available to the scientific community with appropriate best practises and development of other computational tools to facilitate porous materials research
* More select Monte Carlo simulations will also continue to be conducted as part of this PhD either as validation or further investigation of novel discoveries

##### 2018 - 2019 | University of Bath | MRes in the CSCT (Predicted Distinction)
* Conducted an 8 month MRes research project into the combination of novel machine learning algorithms and Monte Carlo simulation for large scale material screenings
* As the CSCT is a doctoral training centre, I have taken advantage of the numerous workshops and skills courses available including (but not limited to): Project management; A week long course on "Product Commercialisation"; A two day training course on "Design of Experiment" by Catalysis Consulting; A day long workshop on patents and other intellectual property; A two week training school in HPC computing at Cambridge, and other software development micro courses
* Lecture courses were also undertaken, each focussing on a separate element of sustainability including engineering, industrial catalysis, and life cycle analysis

##### 2016 - 2017 | Imperial College London | MRes, Green Chemistry, Energy & Environment (Distinction)
* Conducted a year-long, independent research project into sustainable materials for solar cell production
* Strong critical evaluation skills were developed through daily research work and group presentations on the analysis of methodology and claims of research papers
* Awarded first prize for a group research project examining the future of India's energy production and consumption over the next 50 years.

##### 2012 - 2016 | University of St Andrews | BSc Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry (2.1)
* 4 year undergraduate at a world leading university for chemistry teaching and research with knowledge developed through Lectures, tutorials, exams and practical labs
* A year long research project was conducted into sustainable biomaterial valorisation which developed my skills as a scientific researcher

##### Jan 2018 - Present | Self Study | Programming and Software Development
* I am a self taught Python programmer and have developed several programs for a variety of applications
* These programs include: The analysis of Infra-red adsorption spectroscopy through automated peak assignment, a command line journaling tool for storage and retrieval of encrypted text, an automated data pipeline for the continual grouping and analysis of trading cards prices through financial benchmarks, and other projects currently conducted as part of my research
* These programs allowed me to develop a modular programming style for code maintainability and experience with remote version control for more robust code development
* Through my MRes and PhD I have also developed significant experience in scientific programming including: working with standard plotting libraries for data visualisation; the vectorisation of mathematical operations with numpy to reduce run times; the application of singular and ensemble tree based, machine learning classifiers to novel research questions, and the prototyping of novel machine learning algorithms
* I recently attended the two week High Performance Computing Academy at the University of Cambridge to gain further experience in scientific programming and computer architectures, with topics including: C++ programming, continuous integration and testing, and performant programming
* In addition to Python and my brief experience with C++, I am also familiar with bash scripting in a Linux environment and am familiar with the use of various text editors, IDEs, and the Anaconda package management system

#### Research Experience
###### Sept 2018 - May 2019 | University of Bath | Postgraduate Research Project - Supervised by Tina Düren
* Conducted an 8 month research project, performing proof of concept studies on a novel machine learning algorithm to streamline high throughput, Monte Carlo screenings
* The core skills developed during this project were: working with python day to day (particularly the anaconda package management, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and sklearn libraries), and running Monte Carlo simulations of porous materials on a HPC Linux system
* Additionally,  this work allowed me to develop my scientific programming skills; work within a HPC Linux system; bash scripting, and data visualisation
* The result of this work was a proof of concept study which allowed for the "real time" analysis of 69,000 porous structures, resulting in the top 100 performing materials to be identified after assessing only 0.65 % of all the structures by Monte Carlo simulation

###### Nov 2016 - Oct 2017 | Imperial College London | Postgraduate Research Project - Supervised by Martin Heeney
* Conducted an intensive, year-long, independent research project, where I successfully demonstrated biorenewable materials could be utilised as a synthetic precursor for solar cells.
* This research made use of DFT calculations and novel synthetic strategies to investigate and synthesise target materials
* I was given a high degree of autonomy while conducting this research requiring me to develop solutions to large and small problems daily, develop multiple research plans to the research target and fully plan my work well in advance to ensure all required materials were in stock

##### Sept 2015 - May 2016 | University of St Andrews | Undergraduate Research Project - Supervised by Nicholas Westwood
* The results of this project were published in conjunction with other Westwood group research:
 Org. Biomol. Chem., 2016, 14, 10023 - 10030, using organic synthesis to valorise biorenewable aromatic feedstocks for fine chemical production
* Tenacious work ethic was developed throughout the project in order to keep to deadlines and ensure a high standard of research was conducted

#### Work Experience
##### Sept 2017 - August 2018 | RIMES Technologies (Financial data management services) | Account Team Member
* Initially hired as part of a global team of analysts. Daily tasks included: being first point of contact for all of RIMES'300 clients; efficiently analysing anomalies within client’s data; and identifying and fixing errors within RIMES' in house coding language
* Received a rigorous training program teaching me how to use RIMES' in house data analysis tools and develop a strong, working knowledge of financial data
* Due to my proficiency in problem solving, knowledge of the RIMES tools and experience with clients, I was promoted to the account team of RIMES largest client after only six months
* This promotion allowed me to work on the more technical and challenging problems being faced by the client including working on the development and implementation of their new data feed system, the largest single project RIMES had undertaken in their company history
* An ability to prioritise tasks and often work on multiple issues at once has been a key skill I have developed while at RIMES
