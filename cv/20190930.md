#### Education

##### 2016 - 2017|Imperial College London|MRes, Green Chemistry, Energy & Environment (Distinction)
* Conducted an intensive, year-long, independent research project into sustainable solar technologies
* I was exposed to a wide range of sustainable chemical research through weekly presentation and discussion events with my cohort on hydrogen fuel cells, carbon capture and sustainable feedstocks
* Strong critical evaluation skills were developed through daily research work and group presentations on the analysis of methodology and claims of research papers
* Awarded first prize for a group research project examining the future of India's energy production and consumption over the next 50 years. This highlighted how sustainable goals on large scales must be considered from an economic, and political perspective as well as a technological one

##### 2012 - 2016|University of St Andrews|BSc Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry (2.1)
* I developed a strong working knowledge of Organic, Inorganic and Physical chemistry, routinely assessed by weekly tutorials and discussions. These were complemented by near daily experimental work within teaching and research laboratories across all three fields of chemistry mentioned.
* Two major research projects (group and individual) were conducted throughout my degree within the Westwood research group, aiming to realise biorenewable feedstocks for fine chemical production
* A highlight of my degree was constantly being exposed to new and developing areas of chemistry and their impact on society i.e. when I presented to university faculty and my course mates on the use of metal organic frameworks for hydrogen storage.

##### 2014 - Present|Further Qualifications|Self Study
* Currently pursuing the Registered Scientist qualification (RSci) offered by the RSC for scientists looking to develop their independent research abilities, critical thinking and interpersonal skills
* Self-taught computer programming using Python syntax which I used to build a program to help analyse IR and mass spec data during my undergraduate studies.
* I am currently teaching myself data analysis from an audited course at Imperial College

#### Research Experience

###### Nov 2016 - Oct 2017|Imperial College London|Postgraduate Research Project - Supervised by Martin Heeney
* Conducted an intensive, year-long, independent research project, where I successfully demonstrated how biorenewable materials could be utilised as a synthetic precursor for polymers used in solar cells.
* I was given a high degree of autonomy while conducting this research requiring me to develop solutions to large and small problems daily, develop multiple research plans to the research target and fully plan my work well in advance to ensure all required materials were in stock
* A EPSRC standard research proposal was submitted to my supervisor prior to starting lab work, highlighting previous research focusses in the field, and a projected time scale of my research project. Both this and my final thesis were highly praised by faculty members and received top marks

##### Sept 2015 - May 2016|University of St Andrews|Undergraduate Research Project - Supervised by Nicholas Westwood
* The results of this project were published in conjunction with other Westwood group research:
 Org. Biomol. Chem., 2016, 14, 10023 - 10030, using organic synthesis to valorise biorenewable aromatic feedstocks for fine chemical production
* Several synthetic routes were attempted requiring strong problem solving capabilities
* Strong practical and presentation skills were developed in order to conduct high quality research and to present its results to peers and faculty members at the school of chemistry
* Tenacious work ethic was developed throughout the project in order to keep to deadlines and ensure a high standard of research was conducted

#### Work Experience

##### Sept 2017 - August 2018|RIMES Technologies (Financial data management services)|Support Team Analyst
* Currently work as part of a global team of analysts. Daily tasks include: being first point of contact for all of RIMES'300 clients; efficiently analysing anomalies within client’s data; identifying and fixing errors within RIMES' in house coding language, and linking clients to relevant departments
* Experienced a rigorous, month long training program teaching me how to use RIMES' in house data analysis tools and develop a strong, working knowledge of financial data
* As multiple clients will be contacting RIMES with issues at any given moment, an ability to prioritise tasks and often work on multiple issues at once has been a key skill I have developed while at RIMES

##### 2016 Summer|The Big Issue|Glasgow Office & Outreach Volunteer
* Assisted with the sale of magazines to vendors, allocating vending pitches for the week and ensuring records were maintained and up to date
* Travelled extensively within the West of Scotland in order to help and build relationships with street vendors about problems they were experiencing relating to their work, and offering support to vendors who had experienced abuse or been victim to violent crime
* Hosted recruitment sessions for the Big Issue and distributed recruitment materials to agencies supporting the homeless in Glasgow

##### 2015 Summer|YMCA Camp Silver Beach Virginia|Alpine Tower and Zipline Staff Member
* Worked as part of a 13-member team running the climbing activities on camp where we were given full autonomy over the activity, 9:00 - 17:30 each day
* We were responsible for setting up and maintaining all equipment used on the tower and zipline every day and making sure all equipment was safe to be used
* Regular in-services were held where we were trained to conduct 5 minute rescues on the tower in the event of a camper having a medical emergency while climbing or zipping

##### 2015 Summer|YMCA Camp Silver Beach Virginia|Camp Counsellor
* Worked in a 22 member team, caring for 120 campers a week and giving them an incredible summer
* We had full responsibility for our campers and were fully autonomous in conducting our day to day work. Supervision was provided for emergencies but otherwise we were expected to be independent
* A strong sense of initiative and adaptability was required to keep the campers entertained and interested including planning a 3-hour activity every week tailored to the campers living in the cabin.
* Enthusiasm and a strong work ethic were vital as the working day was 15 hours long, every day for 9 weeks but the counsellors needed to display the same energy as the first day on the last day
